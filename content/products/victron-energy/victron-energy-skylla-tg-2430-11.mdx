One full rated output and one 4 Amp output. Charge voltage can be precisely adjusted to suit any battery system. The input for the charger is 230V at 50/60HZ. Charge voltage can be measured directly on the battery terminals in order to compensate for voltage loss due to cable resistance. An external sensor allows measuring battery temperature and compensating charge voltage accordingly.

The SmartShunt is equipped with Bluetooth, a VE.Direct port and a connection that can be used for: monitoring a second battery, midpoint monitoring or a temperature sensor.
