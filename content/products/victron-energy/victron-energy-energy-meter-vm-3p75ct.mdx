Energy Meters are typically used in an Energy Storage System, to measure the power and energy of the entire application at the distribution box and minimises energy import or export to the grid. They can also be used to measure the output of a PV inverter or AC loads and display the data on GX devices such as the Cerbo GX or Ekrano GX and the VRM Portal.

There are several models available from Victron:

- Victron VM-3P75CT energy meter (Ethernet and VE.Can - for threephase, uses supplied CTs, max. 80A per phase)
- ET112 (RS485 - for single-phase max. 100A)
- ET340 (RS485 - for three-phase max. 65A)
- EM24 Ethernet (Ethernet - for three-phase max. 65A)
- EM540 (RS485 - for three-phase max. 65A)
