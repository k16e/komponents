An Inverter/Charger with device networking built-in, the MultiPlus-II GX communicates with a solar charger, batteries, and other devices to control a grid-connected, off-grid, or remote power installation. Capable of parallel operation for increased power output, or battery charge-rates, the MultiPlus-II GX can also be configured for three-phase supply. A host of advanced features - such as uninterrupted power supply, setting load limits, and supplementing limited grid-power availability with battery power - can all be controlled straight from your phone or smart device. Remote monitoring is also possible.
